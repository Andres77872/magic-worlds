                            │   └── styles/
                            └── infrastructure/
                                └── storage/
```

### Import Changes
```typescript
// OLD
import type { Character } from './types'
import { storage } from './services/storage'

// NEW
import type { Character } from '../shared/types'
import { storage } from '../infrastructure/storage'
```

### Context Usage
```typescript
// OLD - Props drilling
function Component({ theme, setTheme, characters, setCharacters }) {
  // ...
}

// NEW - Context hooks
function Component() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
  const { characters, setCharacters } = useData()
  // ...
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Final Testing**: Perform thorough testing and verification
2. **Documentation**: Update component documentation

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **LLM Optimization**: Smaller, focused files are easier for AI to understand
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
4. **Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns and clear organization
5. **Performance**: Better tree-shaking and code splitting opportunities
